# What is WarmAndFuzzies?
Warm and Fuzzies is a website designed to allow users to write heartwarming messages to each other. All messages are placed in the receiver's "bag" which can only be viewed at the end of the event period. 

## Inspiration
The goal of this project is to provide a space for Tomo members to show appreciation to those who have impacted their lives in some way. After COVID-19 stay at home orders, all of our Spring Quarter club activities for our club, Tomo No Kai at UCI, were cancelled. Normally the club has an annual ski trip over spring break where many members get to know each other better, have fun, and at the end write notes of appreciation to each other called "warm and fuzzies" that are placed in bags assigned to each member. We wanted to recreate this important activity on an easily accessible website in order to allow members to engage with each other from their homes. 

### Live Site: COMING SOON! 

## What's Next? 
We are currently working on implementing secure user authentication. In the future our goal is to allow users to create "event walls" and invite users to participate.
